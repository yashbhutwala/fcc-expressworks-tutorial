Going through the [expressworks](https://github.com/azat-co/expressworks) tutorials as part of [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-web-apps-with-expressjs)'s Back End Development Certification.

Putting the solutions here so I can revisit them for reference.

In order to run, first install expressworks using `npm install -g expressworks`. Then, run `expressworks`, select an activity, and to verify my solution run: `expressworks verify {fileLocation}`.
